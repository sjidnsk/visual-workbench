# visual-workbench

Artifact-first evidence workbench for the parent `lunar-path-planning` repository.

This repository is the fourth submodule used by the parent
`lunar-path-planning` repository. It follows the existing sibling submodule
pattern alongside `path-planner`, `model-explorer`, and
`dev-platform-constraints`.

## Scope

- Reads allowlisted artifact roots only:
  - parent `outputs/`
  - `dev-platform-constraints/outputs/`
  - `model-explorer/outputs/`
  - `path-planner/outputs/`
  - paths supplied through `VISUAL_WORKBENCH_ARTIFACT_ROOTS`
- Detects and displays:
  - `model-explorer-contract/v1`
  - `path-planner-sidecar/v1`
  - `path-planner-route/v1`
  - `path-feedback-manifest/v1`
  - `path-feedback-summary/v1`
  - `model-explorer-experiment/v1`
- Allows only white-listed `dry-run` and `validate` command execution.
- Rejects complete experiment `run` requests.

## Mission-Control Direction

### H1 Mission Cockpit

H1 mission cockpit is the next concrete UI architecture. It is a
mission-first interactive evidence cockpit: the left rail keeps mission stages
visible, the center uses `MissionMapReplay` for map replay and layer toggles,
the right side keeps mission judgement close to the active stage, and
`EvidenceChainDrawer` preserves the artifact-first trace.

The cockpit keeps display and interaction on the same screen. Evidence Trace,
Map Replay, and Validate remain stage-local entry points; Validate still permits
only `dry-run` and `validate`. It must not trigger `full run`, `PPO`, or
`training`.

The current UI direction is mission-first, not tool-first. The primary
navigation stages are, in order: 环境测绘, 目标捕获, 路线制导, 可达确认,
风险复核, 任务简报.

The workbench uses a dark mission map/status surface with a light progressive
evidence panel. Raw evidence is hidden by default and revealed through
progressive evidence disclosure so operators can follow the mission state first
and drill into source artifacts only when needed.

Stage-local research entry points are Evidence Trace, Map Replay, and Validate.
Validate remains limited to `dry-run 或 validate`; `完整 run 不会` be triggered
from the UI.

Scope guards remain unchanged: no PPO/training/full run, no network/action
space/default A* changes, no Ackermann-feasible trajectory claim, and no
IRIS/GCS/path-planner diagnostics as release or training proof.

## Non-goals

- No PPO, training, staged release, or full experiment run from the UI.
- No changes to network, action space, default A*, or existing subproject logic.
- No Ackermann-feasible trajectory claim.
- No promotion of IRIS/GCS/path-planner diagnostics into training or release proof.

## Run

Backend:

```powershell
cd visual-workbench
python -m visual_workbench.api
```

Optional demo artifacts when local `outputs/` is empty:

```powershell
$env:VISUAL_WORKBENCH_ARTIFACT_ROOTS='C:\Users\77634\.codex\worktrees\ca49\lunar-path-planning\visual-workbench\fixtures\demo-artifacts'
python -m visual_workbench.api
```

Frontend:

```powershell
cd visual-workbench\web
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Verify

```powershell
cd visual-workbench
python -m pytest
cd web
npm test
npm run build
```

To keep download caches off C by default:

```powershell
$env:PIP_CACHE_DIR='D:\CodexDownloads\pip-cache'
$env:npm_config_cache='D:\CodexDownloads\npm-cache'
```
